# Tarkov Kappa Tracker

A Windows desktop app to track every quest and item needed for **Kappa** in Escape from Tarkov — with a clean dark UI, fast progress tools, and a new **Raid Planner** that shows how many quests are available per map to help choose your next deployment location in Tarkov!

This app is a **Per-user install**, which does not require Admin to install, it makes no system-wide changes, stores your data in your user profile, and can be uninstalled from Apps & Features.
